**The** fun part is we can save our plant and help others simultaneously.

* **Example**: Person A have money but dont have time to give back to the nature, here comes **person b** who has time but want to earn money. So **A** can donate the money through our Website and If **B** wants money he can do this by planting a tree and recording the video of that and submit to website for review phase if review got pass **B** can got money that **A** has donated.

* In this way **A** is helping **B** as well as **Nature** in the same time.
